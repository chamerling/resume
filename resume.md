QuickHub.App is a native OS X application which gives you access to your github resources from the application tray icon.
The application was published on the Mac App Store for more than one year in 2011 and has been downloaded around 1000 times. I decided to stop 'wasting time' on it and open source it some months ago. So you can fork, send pull requests, do whatever you want with it.
Thanks for all developers who bought it on the Mac App Store, you paid me some beers with the money you gave me!
